It calculates the student's academic standing (e.g., **Remedial**, **Average**, **MagnaCumLaude**, **SumaCumLaude**) and ensures all graduation criteria are met, including minimum credits and passing all required courses.

## Features
-  Checks if a student meets all diploma requirements  
-  Calculates total credits earned from passed courses  
-  Determines academic standing based on average marks  
-  Provides detailed graduation results
